## SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Data v4.1

**Originator:** NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM)

**Spatial Coverage:** 3 arc-sec (~90 m) resolution; current for the Contiguous 48 US Statesh

**Temporal Coverage:** atemporal (dated to 2009)

**Variables:** 
* Elevation (m, <16m resolution)

**Method Summary and Comments** The data derive from the USGS/NASA SRTM data. The data currently contains "no-data" holes where water or heavy shadow prevented the quantification of elevation. These are generally small holes, which nevertheless render the data less useful, especially in fields of hydrological modeling. *Verify:* Ihe International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) has  processed this  data  to  provide  seamless continuous topography surfaces. Areas with regions of no  data in the  original SRTM data have been filled using interpolation methods described by Reuter et al. (2007). 

**Uncertainty:** N/A
