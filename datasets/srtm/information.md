## SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Model V4.1

**Originator:** NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM)

**Spatial Coverage:** 3 arc-sec (~90 m) resolution; current for the contiguous 48 US States

**Temporal Coverage:** atemporal (dated to 2009)

**Variables:** 
* Elevation: m, < 16m vertical error

**Uncertainty:** < 16m vertical error

**Method Summary and Comments** These data are provided by the Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The data are post-processed 3-arc second DEM data for the globe. The original SRTM (v1) data has been subjected to a number of processing steps to provide seamless and complete elevational surfaces for the globe. In its original release, SRTM data contained regions of no-data, specifically over water bodies (lakes and rivers), and in areas where insufficient textural detail was available in the original radar images to produce three-dimensional elevational data. The CGIAR-CSI SRTM data product applies a hole-filling algorithm to provide continuous elevational surfaces.
