## PaleoCAR: SW USA Paleoclimatic Reconstruction

**Originator:** Bocinsky, R.K.; Kohler, T.A.

**Spatial Coverage:** 30 arc-sec (~800 m) resolution; the Four Corners states: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, & Utah

**Temporal Coverage:** annual resolution; 1–2000 CE

**Variables:** 
* Growing Degree Days (GDD): F deg.; Growing Season: May–Sept.
* Precipitation: mm; Water Year (prev. Oct through listed year Sept
* Maize Farming Niche: (based on direct precipitation) In niche if Growing Season F GDD (as above) >= 1800 & Water Year Precip. (as above) >= 300 mm; otherwise out of niche. 

**Uncertainty:** The uncertainty for GDD and Precipitation that os available on the graph and in the graph data download csv represents the predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) statistic for each cell's reconstruction. [add uncertainty for maize farming niche]

**Method Summary and Comments:** For each pixel, for each year, the model selects the tree ring chronologies (within a 10-degree buffer of the Four Corners states; from the National Tree Ring Database) that best predict PRISM data for that location and uses linear regression to estimate the paleoenvironmental variable for that date and location.

Because the Maize Farming Niche is based on direct precipitation, maize farming may be possible if other water sources are utilized (e.g. spring or rivers) or if precipitation is concentrated on fields through water diversion structures (e.g. *ak chin* fields) or geologically (e.g. sand dune fields).
