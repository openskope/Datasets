* Mean Daily Min. Temp.: deg. F, monthly
* Monthly Precipitation: in., monthly

**Uncertainty:** Uncertainty information is not available for PRISM

**Method Summary and Comments** The PRISM Climate Group gathers climate observations from a wide range of monitoring networks, applies sophisticated quality control measures, and develops spatial climate datasets to reveal short- and long-term climate patterns. The resulting datasets incorporate a variety of modeling techniques and are available at multiple spatial/temporal resolutions, covering the period from 1895 to the present. Whenever possible, these datasets are offered to the public, either free of charge or for a fee (depending on dataset size/complexity and funding available for the activity).

Time series datasets prior to 1981 are modeled using climatologically-aided interpolation (CAI), which uses the long-term average pattern (i.e., the 30-year normals) as first-guess of the spatial pattern of climatic conditions for a given month or day. CAI is robust to wide variations in station data density, which is necessary when modeling long time series. Data is based on monthly modeling.
